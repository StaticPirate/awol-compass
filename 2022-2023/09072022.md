# Week 1

Welcome to the first week of the 2022-2023 Coding AWOL. 

# Introduction

* I'm Adam Bourg. I'm 33 years old married to Christin Bourg and we have 1 child, a son, Luke. He's in his first year of Childrens house while his mom is the sped teacher for the high school this year. 
* I've been around compass 7 years, this is my second year teaching an AWOL 
* I'm a professional software engineer, currently employed by a big accounting firm (PwC) 
* In my free time I love to teach programming, aurge with idiots on the internet and cook. 
* I first learned programming, basic HTML and CSS, when I was 12

# Course Format

* This course works best as a lab format
* I will present a concept, show you some code, discuss an idea and you will eventually copy that code onto your own workspace and run that code
* After I've exhausted what I've prepared for the day, you're free to experiment with the computer and mess around with the code we've written 
* If you need to use the bathroom or leave, please have the courtesy to let me know (Hey Adam, I'm going to the bathroom)
* I generally take a break between 1 and 1:30 for 5 minutes so people can catch up or use the bathroom 

# What is programming
* Programming is more like a very specific instructions on how to bake a cake, then it is a math equation
* Yes, there is math theory behind programming, but you will almost never encounter it outside of academics 
* If you can count, add and subtract, you too can program. Infact computers really only know how to add, subtraction is just a shifting exercise, same with division and multiplication; computers just loop until it's done. 
* Baking a cake is pretty specific order of operations, programming is even more specific in that it doesn't just tell you what to do, but how to do it. 

# Bake a microwave cake
(https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/241038/microwave-chocolate-mug-cake/) 
* To bake a microwave cake you need the following: 
* 1/4 cup flour 
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 2 tablespoons cocoa powder
* 1/8 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/8 teaspoon salt
* 3 tablespoons milk
* 2 tablespoons oil 
* 1 tablespoon water
* 1/4 teaspoon vanilla

What a yummy dish, to make this dish you would: 
1. Mix all the dry ingridents into a microwave safe cup
2. Stir in Milk, oil, water and vanilla 
3. Microwave until the middle is done, approx 1 minute and 45 seconds
4. Serve with a bowl of ice cream on the side 

# This is specific but programming is more specific

Generally you don't do something weird like take the milk then mix the flour, then add salt, microwave and then add everything else then microwave again. You go through it step by step. But notice I never told you how to do this recipe. It's implied you have a measuring cup, you have measuring spoons, you know where they are, you know where the supplies are and they're readily available to you. 

If I were to give these instructions to a computer it wouldn't know what to do! I need to tell it very percise instructions: 

```js
start in kitchen();
walkSteps(5);
openPantryDoor();
pullOutObject('Flour Container'); 
closePantryDoor(); 
walkSteps(-5);
setObjectOnCounter('Flour Container'); 
openObject('lid', 'Flour Container'); 
scoop('.25 cup', 'flour');
dump('.25 cup').into('bowl'); 

walkSteps(5);
openPantryDoor();
pullOutObject('Sugar Container'); 
closePantryDoor(); 
walkSteps(-5);
setObjectOnCounter('Sugar Container'); 
openObject('lid', 'Sugar Container'); 
scoop('.25 cup', 'Sugar');
dump('.25 cup').into('bowl'); 

and so on. 

```

As you can see, with a computer I have to tell it specific steps to take such as walking, scooping, dumping and eventually mixing and baking.
