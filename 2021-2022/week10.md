Week 10,

AGENDA: 
* Overview of HTML forms, drop downs, input fields, sliders etc... 
* Review the HW assignment and implement it live in class
* Talk about next week's HW assignment

# Week 10 Homework assignment: 
* Implement the following coding challenges on your own

# First Challenge 
Kth Largest Element in an Array Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
Exampe 1: Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2 Output: 5

Example 2: Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4 Output: 4

**Note: ** You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

Write a function to find the kth largest element in an array. The function should return the actual number.

# Second Challenge

String Permutation is Palindrome? pal·in·drome A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.
Write a function to determine if input string is a palindrome. Example palindromes: madam, nurses run, racecar, redivider, deified, civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak and reviver.

The function should return true or false.
