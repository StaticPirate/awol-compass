# Welcome to week 8

We're going to take the first 30-60 minutes of today's class to run through an Agile Retrospective. 

# Today's goals

1. Gather feedback on where we stand on the course, what the group feels like we/(or Adam) could improve on (60 minutes)
2. Review what we've learned so far 
    (Group decision)

# Specific questions to think about for feedback

1. How is the speed / pace of the content coming at you in the class? 
2. How is the content of the class? 
3. What could Adam do to improve the class? 
4. Would homework / out of class assignments help? 
5. Would you like practice problems or resources?

# The Agile Manifesto
We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
Working software over comprehensive documentation
Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more.

# What is Agile? What is a retrospective? 

Here's a great explanation of a retrospective

Here's what Agile means within the context of software development:

# Retro format

Please print, do not write in cursive. I cannot read cursive. 

A: Write down all the pluses and minuses (10 minutes)
B: Once done, we'll pile the notes together, all pluses in one section and minuses in another (3 minutes)
C: 3 randomly selected students will come up and organize the sticky notes and try to group them (10 minutes)
D: I will go up to the board and review the notes with the whole class (40 minutes)

# Retro details 

1. Write down all the good things that are happening within the context of the awol (These are the plus sign section)
    Examples: 
        I love it when I show Adam a problem and he doesn't know the answer but quickly solves it
2. Write down all the bad things that are happening within the context of the awol (these are the minuses)
    Examples:
        I wish Adam would slow down and give more chances to practice the code
        I wish we could go slower

# Next steps: 

Action items from the sticky notes
