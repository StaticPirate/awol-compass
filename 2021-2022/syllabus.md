Week 9,
* Review the HW assignment and implement it live in class 
* HTML and CSS: layouts, style and design
    * Flexbox
    * Designing Mobile websites
    * CSS Box model
* Build a Retrospective Sticky Note builder using HTML and CSS
    * HTML elements: Input fields, drop downs, tables, buttons and things like that
* Save the stickies to JSON and provide a text box to export the JSON to the user 
** Maybe Make an API call to save the data?!?!? 

Homework assignment: 
* Create a user interface using HTML and CSS to display the student data from week 8 in a HTML table. 
* Add drop downs to support ability to filter the table based off:
    * Grade (Use a slider?)

    * Age 
    * GPA 

# November 
Back to the basics, javascript, html and CSS. A deeper dive. 

## November 3 
Week 10, 

* Review the HW assignment and implement it live in class 
* Continue the Retrospective Sticky Note builder using HTML and CSS
    * Make API calls to add sticky notes, remove sticky notes and fetch stickies
    * Add ability to have stickies bunched / categorized by retrospective date or label

* Homework assignment

Implement the following coding challenges on your own: 

1. Kth Largest Element in an Array
Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Exampe 1: 
Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2
Output: 5

Example 2: 
Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4
Output: 4

**Note: ** You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

Write a function to find the kth largest element in an array. The function should return the actual number. 

2. String Permutation is Palindrome?
pal·in·drome
    A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.

Write a function to determine if input string is a palindrome. Example palindromes: 
madam, nurses run, racecar, redivider, deified, civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak and reviver.

The function should return true or false. 


## November 10 
Week 11,

* Review the HW assignment and implement it live in class 
* Dive into APIs, how to make api calls, $.ajax and a deeper dive into the some of the common tools we use to get our job done 

Homework assignment: 

1. Implement a function that will compute Multiples of 3 or 5, it will return the list of the multiples and the sum. 

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Example: 
mutiples(10)

Return:
{
    numbers: [3,5,6,9]
    sum: 23
}

Output the return value to the console. 

## November 17
Week 12,
