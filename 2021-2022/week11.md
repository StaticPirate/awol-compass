# Agenda: 

* Review week 10 home work assignment


# Week 10 Homework assignment: 
* Implement the following coding challenges on your own

# First Challenge 
Kth Largest Element in an Array Find the kth largest element in an unsorted array. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.
Exampe 1: Input: [3,2,1,5,6,4] and k = 2 Output: 5

Example 2: Input: [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6] and k = 4 Output: 4

**Note: ** You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ array's length.

Write a function to find the kth largest element in an array. The function should return the actual number.

# Second Challenge

String Permutation is Palindrome? pal·in·drome A word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward, e.g., madam or nurses run.
Write a function to determine if input string is a palindrome. Example palindromes: madam, nurses run, racecar, redivider, deified, civic, radar, level, rotor, kayak and reviver.

The function should return true or false.


# Lecture

Lets spend more time getting familar with javascript data structures and writing functions.

# Week 11 Home work assignment

Homework assignment:

Implement a function that will compute Multiples of 3 or 5, it will return the list of the multiples and the sum.
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. https://projecteuler.net/problem=1

Example: mutiples(10)

Return: { numbers: [3,5,6,9] sum: 23 }

Output the return value to the console.
