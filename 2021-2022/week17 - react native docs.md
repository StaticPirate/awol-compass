# Today's Awol 

# Introduction

Today is self study focused. You can use Expo Snacks to explore the concepts, but you will be hopefully reviewing current material as well as learning some new information. 

# Why we're doing this

Self study is vitally important to being a capable and proficent developer. I've run across many developers in my career that couldn't be bothered to read the documentation or how to guides. These people quickly get fired or move on from the company. You can ignore docs and build and bang on it until it works, or you can try to understand what's going on and why. 

# Process

Using the React Native Express guide and the Expo Snack concept. I want you to create (1) Expo Snack and use it for your study. If you benefit from typing or need the pratice this is a great time to do it. Basically type or code the code from the example into your snack and run the code. 

Try to fix errors before you ask for help. Sometimes the error can be really helpful; eg "undeclared variable" or simple like forgetting a closing bracket.
