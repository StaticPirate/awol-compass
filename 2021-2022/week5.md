# Welcome to week 5 of awol

This week I have a lot of important meetings, therefore I won't be
able to join you in class. That's ok as there is much learning to be
done.

# Roster

Please reply to this email when you start your AWOL.

# Today's activity

Using jquery we're going to build a product list and if we have time,
we're going to have the ability to add a product to the list. Bonus
points for supporting the ability to delete.

Here is the API documentation:

https://fakestoreapi.com/docs

# Goals today

1. Interact with an API
2. List all products from the API
3. Add a product
4. Delete a product

# Boilerplate

I've set up some basic to do app in code pen available here:

# Copy the code pen into

Look for a 'fork' button on the website. Click it and it will copy it
into your account. Could be at the top or bottom right of the page.
Control + f to help find it often helps.

# Working through the problems / overview

In general, I wrote most of the code for you. You need to call an api
using $.ajax and display a list of products, add one as well as delete
one.

// indicates the thing is in comments, meaning it won't run as code.
There are comments about the code and what to do as a guideline, the
goal here is to have you read code, implement it and move along.

// TO DO indicates what you need to work on.

# Need help?

Email me, Adam.Bourg@gmail.com and provide a link to your pen.

# Working solution

Here's the working solution to the problem

https://codepen.io/adambourg/pen/gORqdrg

# Guidelines

Look at the solution and see what it does. Add a product, delete one
and refresh the page. Read the code. Do not copy the code.

Once you have an idea of what it's supposed to do, implement the list
function. This is the most simple task of these. Once you have this,
move on to delete then finally add.

Again, don't copy the code, try to understand the code and implement
your own solution.

If you're left with extra time, what else can you do? The API docs
support pagination, sorting, search, category selection etc... could
you implement buttons to allow you to sort, filter or categorize
things?

See you next week!
