# Week 24

This week we're building more apps. 

# Remember Open Weather API? 

Bare Bones: 
-Goal today is to build an app, that takes the current location (hard code zip), gets the weather for the location. 

Nice to have: 
- City Name, icons for the type of weather eg cloudy, sunny, etc... 
- Ability to add cities
